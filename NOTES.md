#December 18 2018A JMJ Structural Design
Desired features
- Use off-the-shelf components; keep custom components to a minimum. Makes it easier to replicate
- Support two 24" monitors and the central mirror aparatus
- Be adjustable, but once adjusted and locked should keep adjustments even if someone bumps into
  the structure
- Assume monitors have VESA mounts

Design
- Two camera tripods or light fixture tripods beefy enough to support a monitor each,
connected by a custom horizontal bar
- The mirrors hang down from the horizontal bar.

#November 30 2018A JMJ Results of Priliminary Experiments
- 24" monitor, placed vertical provides the best coverage. A 21" would also work, but would be
  a bit too close.
- Angle of mirror should be 80-degrees. While 45 degrees would be ideal as having the smallest
  angle of reflection overall, and in which the monitors would presumable be facing each
  other exactly, in 
 

#November 24 2018A JMJ Making Monitor Mock-ups

HDMI Monitor Dimensions:
21.5" 16:9: Width 18.74 inches Height 10.54 inches
	Approx: 18 3/4 x 10 1/2

24" 16:9    Width: 20.92 inches Height 11.77 inches
	Approx: 21 7/8 x 11 3/4

I cut out two identical pieces of 1/8" white actylic(?) sheet. Each sheet is slightly
larger than a 24" display. On these I marked the outlines for 21.5" and 24" displays.
These will serve as proxy monitors for tests with the mirrors.
