#November 24 2018A JMJ Making Monitor Mock-ups

HDMI Monitor Dimensions:
21.5" 16:9: Width 18.74 inches Height 10.54 inches
	Approx: 18 3/4 x 10 1/2

24" 16:9    Width: 20.92 inches Height 11.77 inches
	Approx: 21 7/8 x 11 3/4

I cut out two identical pieces of 1/8" white actylic(?) sheet. Each sheet is slightly
larger than a 24" display. On these I marked the outlines for 21.5" and 24" displays.
These will serve as proxy monitors for tests with the mirrors.
